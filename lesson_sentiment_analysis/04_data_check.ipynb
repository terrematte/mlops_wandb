        "In the provided Python exercise, a series of tests were formulated and executed to verify the integrity and structure of a cleaned dataset obtained from a **``Weights & Biases (wandb)``** artifact named **``clean_data``**. The dataset comprises text files categorized into positive and negative sentiments, stored in two directories named **``pos``** and **``neg``**. The tests were conducted to ensure that the data is in the expected format and adheres to certain criteria before proceeding with further analysis or modeling tasks.\n",

        "Hereâ€™s a summary of the tests conducted:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Directory Existence**:\n",
        "Checked whether the directories **``pos``** and **``neg``** exist within the downloaded artifact.\n",

        "2. **Instance Count**:\n",
        "Verified that there are at least 500 instances (files) in each of the **``pos``** and **``neg``** directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Duplicate Verification**:\n",
        "Ensured that there are no duplicate files within and across the **``pos``** and **``neg``** directories by comparing filenames. This test operates under the assumption that unique filenames correspond to unique content.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **File Non-emptiness**:\n",
        "Checked that each file in the **``pos``** and **``neg``** directories is not empty, ensuring that every file contains some data.\n",
        "\n",
        "These tests were structured within a Python script using the **pytest** framework. The script initiates a **wandb** run to log any potential issues and utilizes a **fixture** to download the **``clean_data``** artifact from **wandb**, providing a local path to the data for the tests. Each test is defined as a separate function, and the pytest command at the end of the script executes all tests, providing a detailed output of the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "This verification process is crucial as it ensures the cleaned dataset is well-structured, free of duplicates, and ready for subsequent analysis or machine learning tasks. By logging the results to **wandb**, there's a traceable record of the data verification process, which contributes to the reproducibility and reliability of the analysis pipeline."
